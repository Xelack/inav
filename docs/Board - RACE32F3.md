## Hardware Features

* Hybrid plug setup, JST plugs and through holes for pin connectors. No compromise on ports. Full feature support of all modules, all at the same time.
* Black box flight log recorder â€” high capacity on-board storage for easy tuning optimization, flight replay, and troubleshooting.
* Next-generation STM32 F3 processor with faster ARM-Cortex M4 core with floating point hardware unit for efficient flight calculations. Loop times are up to twice as fast as previous-generation STM32F1 based boards.
* Stackable design - perfect for integrating with OSDs and power distribution boards.
* All plugs are located on the same side of the board for a more space-efficient design.
* 4 PWM 3Pin though-holes connectors, 8 PWM JST Plug for ESCs, Servos and legacy receivers. Full support for OneShot ESCs.
* Supports SBus, SumH, SumD, Spektrum1024/2048, XBus, PPM, PWM receivers. Built-in inverters.
* Dedicated output for programmable LEDs.
* PWR ports for voltage and current.
* Sonar support for precision low-altitude position hold.
* Buzzer port for wamings and notifications.
* Barometer mounted on the bottom of the board for easy wind isolation.
* Configuration of the flight controller via a cross-platform GUI (Windows/OSX/Linux).
* upports a variety of aircraft, tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, planes and more.
* Micro USB socket.
* 2x6pin JST-SH sockets (PWR,GPS/12C).
* 3x4pin JST-SH sockets (OSD/TELEMTRY,UART3/ SERIAL RX,LED,RSSI)
* 1x8pin JST-SH sockets (PPM,PWM,5V,GND)
* 1x1Opin JST-SH sockets (ESC/Servo connections, 5V, GND).
